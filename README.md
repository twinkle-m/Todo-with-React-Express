CREATE TABLE
  `tasks` (
    `id` int unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `taskName` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    `complete` tinyint(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
    PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
  ) ENGINE = InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT = 1 DEFAULT CHARSET = utf8mb4 COLLATE = utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci

Step 3: in /src folder, set environment variables in the .env file

Step 4: If you have changed the port, make sure to change the proxy in the package.json file

The project is now ready to run.
